              <p>
                As an accomplished Python Programmer with a PCEP certification from the Python Institute and over 300 hours of hands-on 
                experience, I bring a wealth of technical knowledge to the table. With a Bachelor's degree in Finance from CSUN and 
                previous licensure in the insurance industry, I have also honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, making me 
                an asset to any team.  
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my programming expertise, I have extensive experience in ecommerce and online 
                sales, having fulfilled thousands of orders on Amazon, eBay, and Facebook since 2015. I am also the creator of two former 
                brands, Grid Gear and Zentek, which provided me with valuable insights into product sourcing, branding, and marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my professional background, I have gained valuable experience in customer service as a food 
                courier at DoorDash and Uber. Through these roles, I have developed exceptional communication and time-management skills, which
                have been instrumental in my success.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, I am a highly driven and dedicated individual who is passionate about leveraging my diverse skill set to contribute 
                to the success of any project or organization.
