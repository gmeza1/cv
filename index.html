                As a proficient Python Programmer with a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep">PCEP</a>

              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my programming technical skills, I have extensive experience in ecommerce and online 
                sales, having fulfilled thousands of orders on Amazon, eBay, and Facebook. I am also the creator of two former 
                brands, Grid Gear and Zentek, which provided me with valuable insights into product sourcing, branding, and marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have gained valuable experience in customer service as a food courier at DoorDash and Uber. Through these roles, I 
                have developed exceptional communication and time-management skills, which have been instrumental in my success.
              </p>
              <p>
